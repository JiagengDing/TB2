    "# FTGP Week 2: Blockchain fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will use the cryptographic primitives we saw last week to build our own blockchain!\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how a typical blockchain works is a key part of understanding the benefits (and drawbacks) this technology brings. Knowing how the underling systems works, will also improve your ability to build financial applications on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Python and the packages we used last week, plus you might the following packages: `json`, `cbor` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html, https://cbor2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** The following worksheet requires good programming skills. However, the aim of the worksheet is not to teach you how to code, but to allow you to build your own blockchain system. If you are not feeling confident in your programming abilities, you might wish to use a non-programming alternative, ETH.build (https://sandbox.eth.build/). A series of helpful videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJz1HruEnenCXH7KW7wBCEBnBLOVkiqIi) is also available to guide you throughout the process.\n",

    "- sender's public key\n",
    "- receiver's public key\n",

    "- comment (arbitrary text, can be empty)\n",
    "- sender's signature (signing the transaction data)\n",

    "- new: to create a new transaction\n",
    "- sign: to sign the transaction data and produce a valid signature\n",
    "- validate: to validate a transaction\n",

    "- Implement the `resolve()` method, that returns the longest chain (e.g., it can return the latest block of the longest chain). \n",
    "- At the moment, our blockchain system doesn't perform any checks on the transactions (apart from verifying the signature). Modify your block implementation so that each block contains a record of user accounts (i.e. mapping from public keys to balances). \n",
    "- Then create a method that makes sure that a transaction is valid (given the block's user record) before adding it to the block. Otherwise the transaction should be discarded without any state changes.\n",
    "- At the moment, transactions can be repeated. Add a counter associated with each account that makes each transaction unique.\n",
